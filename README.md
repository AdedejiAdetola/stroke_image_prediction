# Stroke Image Prediction

## Overview
Stroke Image Prediction is a deep learning project for medical image analysis using TensorFlow and Python. The model is designed to analyze medical images and predict the likelihood of a stroke occurrence based on given input data. This project aims to aid in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes by leveraging deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification
- Implements TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning
- Supports data preprocessing, augmentation, and model training
- Evaluates model performance using various metrics
- Provides visualization of predictions and model insights

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
The project requires a dataset containing labeled stroke-related medical images. If using a publicly available dataset, ensure it is properly preprocessed before training.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/stroke-image-prediction.git
cd stroke-image-prediction
```
2. Prepare the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Run the preprocessing script to clean and format data:
```bash
python preprocess.py
```
4. Train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```
5. Evaluate the model:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
6. Use the trained model to make predictions:
```bash
python predict.py --image path_to_image
```

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features from medical images and classify them effectively.

## Results
The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are visualized using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
